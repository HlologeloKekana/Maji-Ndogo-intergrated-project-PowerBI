# Maji-Ndogo-intergrated-project-PowerBI
Created public dashboards that visualizes data on gender inequality, infrastructure, and water availability in the fictional nation of Maji Ndogo.The project demonstrate how rural communities mostly rely on communal taps and wells, how women bear a disproportionate amount of the effort of collecting water and are more likely to experience criminal activity, and how inadequate infrastructure—such as broken taps—contributes to long lines and health problems.  The project tracks funds needed for improvements, monitors progress, and aims to improve water access, reduce gender inequality, and decrease crime associated with water sources.
